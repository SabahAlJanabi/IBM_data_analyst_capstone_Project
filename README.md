# IBM Data Analysis Professional Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Analysis Professional Certificate. The capstone project demonstrates the application of various data analysis skills acquired throughout the course, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, and visualization, as well as the use of Python for data science.
In addition to the data analysis and visualizations included in this project, an interactive dashboard has been created to provide a dynamic view of the results. The dashboard allows users to explore the analyzed data in greater depth, with various filters and visualization tools to customize the view according to specific needs. You can access the dashboard via the following URL: [IBM Data Analysis Professional Capstone Dashboard](https://us3.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=dashboard&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BData%2BAnalysis%2BProfessional%2BCapstone%2FIBM%2BData%2BAnalysis%2BProfessional%2BCapstone&action=view&mode=dashboard&subView=model000001914ae403a9_00000002). This dashboard is an integral part of the capstone project and offers a user-friendly interface for engaging with the projectâ€™s insights.
## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present findings through visualizations and reports. The project involves:

- **Data Collection:** Fetching data through a REST API.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
- **Reporting:** Summarizing the analysis in a clear and concise report.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For developing and documenting the analysis process.
- **REST API:** For data retrieval from external sources.
- **Excel:** For storing the final results and facilitating further analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Includes any raw or cleaned datasets used in the project.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data processing, cleaning, and fetching data from the API.
- **`output/`**: Final reports, visualizations, and the Excel file containing the analyzed data.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation

To run the project locally, ensure that you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include all dependencies, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `requests`.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ibm-data-analysis-capstone.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ibm-data-analysis-capstone
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks:**

   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` files in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis.

4. **Fetch new data:**

   If you want to update the data, run the script in the `scripts/` directory to pull data from the API and store it in the `data/` folder.

## Results

The analysis results are documented in the `output/` directory, including:

- **Excel File:** `job_postings_analysis.xlsx` containing the cleaned and analyzed data.
- **Visualizations:** Charts and graphs summarizing key findings.
- **Report:** A final report outlining the insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
